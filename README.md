**How Does [Liver Guard Plus](https://groups.google.com/g/liver-guard-plus-review/c/FYPpXPTUqa0) Work?**

According to the Liver Guard Plus website, your liver cells are dying because of free radicals and antioxidants that damage the liver cells and tissues. Millions of Americans suffer from mild liver damage, which keeps rising.

Liver decline and toxicity are curable; you don't have to undergo a liver transplant or keep taking dangerous prescription medication for the rest of your life. Liver damage leaves you vulnerable to adverse side effects and life-threatening symptoms like bleeding disorders, kidney failure, and infections.

The gut microbes enhance the absorption of toxic substances, stimulating fat accumulation inside and around your liver. The microbes carry the harmful elements through the intestinal wall into the bloodstream and liver.

Harmful bacteria are everywhere, and it's nearly impossible to avoid them. The gut can flush out some of the microbes, but its ability to flush them out deteriorates as we age. The microbes bypass the digestion process and reach the liver due to the thinness of the intestinal walls.

Liver Guard Plus targets the root cause of liver decline by offering a natural defense mechanism for your liver cells and tissues. It provides short-term and long-term recovery benefits that improve your quality of life.

[Liver Guard Plus](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/b9eb3c33-0f1b-43f9-9a6d-97f3af10320d/page/mOWYD) ingredients work by inhibiting harmful microbes from penetrating the bloodstream and attacking liver cells. The formula enables your liver cells to recover themselves.

**Step 1: Absorption of Potent Nutrients**

Nutrient absorption starts as soon as you ingest the Liver Guard Plus capsules. The formula contains ingredients from the most potent sources in the world. The nutrients help remove harmful microbes that cause liver damage. They also nourish and repair damaged liver cells.

**Step 2: Liver Cell Degradation Stops**

**Step 3: The Liver Regenerates Itself and Fights the Disease**

[Liver Guard Plus](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12IEtbONaZcGKZgTSp_ihD_vwO20UnLN1#scrollTo=AmycFAMnVfcM) has 26 natural ingredients that fight inflammation and protect the liver from future damage through its powerful antioxidants. The formula is fiber-rich, supporting digestive health and improving bile flow.

**The Ingredients in Liver Guard Plus**

Liver Guard Plus has a powerful combination of 26 ingredients that fight inflammation, improve liver function, and promote liver health. Below are some active ingredients in the liver formula:

**Milk Thistle**

Milk thistle is a known natural remedy for liver issues. It is rich in silymarin, a powerful antioxidant that protects the liver against damage. According to studies, milk thistle can improve liver function and reduce inflammation. The antioxidant properties in milk thistle protect you from other diseases and improve overall health. Additionally, the ingredient lowers cholesterol levels and aids in digestion.

**Beet Root**

The root vegetable has important medicinal properties. It contains betaine, an antioxidant that protects the liver against free radicals, toxins, and damage by oxidative stress. Betaine supports a healthy anti-inflammatory response in the liver, thus reducing the risk of liver-related diseases. Beetroot has high fiber content, supporting fat digestion and enhancing liver function.

**Dandelion**

Dandelion roots and leaves are prevalent in treating liver conditions. The ingredient supports liver health by improving bile flow, which is helpful in the digestion and absorption of fats. Bile is released from the gallbladder when we consume fatty foods to help break down the fat into energy. The sesquiterpene lactones in dandelions increase bile production and reduce digestive issues like bloating, constipation, and indigestion. The dandelion's antioxidants protect the liver from damage caused by free radicals and toxins.

**Jujube Seed**

In [Liver Guard Plus](https://bookshop.org/wishlists/de013d743624590e7545dfb1b8333c0b06aa0c7b), Jujube seed clears the pathways to supply oxygen and nutrients to the liver. It reduces liver inflammation for optimal function. Recent studies suggest that jujube seed enhances liver function and lessens liver damage caused by hepatitis and liver fibrosis. Jujube seed regulates cholesterol levels and promotes heart health by controlling lipid metabolism. Additionally, the ingredient has calming and soothing properties that reduce stress and anxiety, thus preventing liver damage.

**L-cysteine**

This non-essential amino acid in [Liver Guard Plus](https://www.scoop.it/topic/liver-guard-plus-by-liver-guard-plus-official?curate=true&onb=1&loader=1) supports the liver cells by enabling them to send purifying signals into the bloodstream and gut. It clears microbes and toxins from the bloodstream and gut.
